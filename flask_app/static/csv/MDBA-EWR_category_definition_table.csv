Category,Description
Cease to flows,Cease to flows are a single EWR category that fall across all LTWP areas. They largely describe the maximum periods of no flow recommended in each planning unit. Some LTWPs also have cease to flows that are ecologically required in the system (e.g. in the case of naturally ephemeral rivers and creeks).
Low flows,"Low flows comprise of several EWR categories, primarily very low flows and base flows, that fall across all LTWP areas. Very low flows (VF/VL)2 are the minimum flow in a channel that prevents a cease to flow. They provide connectivity between some pools. Baseflows (BF)2provide connectivity between pools and riffles and along channels. They provide sufficient depth for fish movement along reaches and the seasonality of BF2 targets recruitment."
Standard flows,"Standard flows fall broadly into four categories, small fresh, large fresh, bankfull/ anabranch connecting flow and overbank/ wetland connecting flow. The differing EWR codes that represent these are outlined in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12. They aim to achieve a multitude of environmental objectives which are outlined in the relevant LTWPs"
Volumetric,"Volumetric EWRS consist of large fresh, wetland inundating and overbank EWRs that are expressed as of volume of flow at a gauge in a period of time rather than a flow threshold as in the standard flow EWRs"
Multigauge,Multigauge EWRs are restricted to two lots of combined gauges 421090/421088 and 423001/423002 in the Macquarie and Intersecting Streams respectively (Table 15). They follow the same logic as volumetric EWRs but are the combined volume at the two gauges specified. This is identified through the main gauge column in the parameter sheet and an additional multigauge column that lists the second gauge to be considered
Weir Pool,Weir pool EWRs have been developed for river reaches of the Murray that are influenced by weir pools
Lake level,"Lake level EWRs occur primarily in the Murray-Lower darling however, there is a single lake level EWR for Lake Cargelligo in the Lachlan (Table 19). They achieve a range of ecological objectives that are specific to each location and align aim to achieve ecological whilst meeting operational requirements within the lakes."
Nesting flow,"Nesting flow EWRs are a seasonal period of flow during which unnaturally rapid change in water levels are avoided. This is timed during the predictable spring breeding season for nesting River Specialists (e.g. Murray Cod, Freshwater Catfish) to avoid the stranding or abandonment of nests. The assessment method has been developed based to represent the intent of these EWRs from the Fish and Flows in the Southern Murray-Darling Basin documentation by Ellis et al (2022). These EWRs occur at both flow gauges and in weir pools and have been split as such which slightly different assessment methods."
