Cease to flow,Cease to flow,"CF, CF1",Mostly used when only a single CTF EWR applies to a planning unit. These tend to be zero duration cease to flow requirements (indicating cease-to-flow events should not occur in the river/creek) or cease to flow requirements informed by expert opinion.,
Cease to flow,Cease to flow,"CF_a, CF1_a","Specifies the maximum duration of cease to flow events in ‘typical years’, which is one of two durations specified in CTF EWRs in most LTWPs. In the development of LTWPs, this ‘typical year’ maximum CTF duration was based on the 50th percentile CTF duration in the modelled ‘without development’ flow timeseries at the relevant gauge (and/or observed flow timeseries for some gauges). For the purpose of testing CF_a / CF1_a achievement, the EWR_tool tests if the total number of days of cease to flows in a given year is less than the maximum recommended duration for ‘typical years’. No frequency is assigned to CF_a/CF1_a at this stage.",
Cease to flow,Cease to flow,"CF_b, CF1_b","Specifies the maximum duration of cease to flow events in ‘dry years’, which is one of two durations specified in CTF EWRs in most LTWPs. In the development of LTWPs, this ‘dry year’ maximum CTF duration was based on the 95th percentile CTF duration in the modelled ‘without development’ flow timeseries at the relevant gauge (and/or observed flow timeseries for some gauges). For the purpose of testing CF_b / CF1_b achievement, the EWR_tool tests if the total number of days of cease to flows in a given year is less than the maximum recommended duration for ‘dry years’. It also assesses the frequency.",
Cease to flow,Cease to flow,"CF_c, CF1_c",Number of years (expressed as a frequency percentage) that cease to flow events of any duration should occur. Duration is set as 1 day. This aligns with the expressed CTF event frequency in the LTWPs.,
Cease to flow,Cease to flow,CF1_d,This CTF EWR only occurs in one location in the Murrumbidgee LTWP. The duration of cease to flow event aligns with the 75th percentile for that gauge and should occur no more than 25% of the time (frequency).,Murrumbidgee
Cease to flow,Cease to flow,"CF1_cool, CF1_hot",These cease to flow EWRs are present only in the Gwydir and are based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in modelling for low flows. They represent the maximum range of cease to flow durations throughout seasons. This seasonality is currently not included in the tool and the range of EWRs are assessed for across the whole year.,Gwydir
Cease to flow,Cease to flow,ALT_CF,Duration of base flow one events that occur at the 50th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur at a minimum of 50% of the time (frequency). This aligns with preferred or typical duration expressed in the LTWPs. The logic of this CTF EWR aligns with the assessment method for standard EWRs and as the durations are less than 365. it can be assessed using the standard flow logic. This CTF EWR is only encountered in the Murray-Lower Darling LTWP area.,
Low flow,Very low flow,"VF, VF1",When individual very low flow events are assigned to a planning unit. Parameter information based on percentiles or expert opinion.,
Low flow,Very low flow,"VF_a, VF1_a, VL_a",Very low flow events where durations largely occur at the 50th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur at a minimum of 50% of the time (frequency).

The exception for this rule in the Gwydir LTWP which is largely based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in the modelling of low flows.,
Low flow,Very low flow,"VF_b, VF1_b, VL_b",Very low flow events where durations largely occur at the 5th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur 100% of the time (frequency) to avoid extreme events. This aligns with “dry or very dry years” durations expressed in the LTWPs. The exception for this rule in the Gwydir LTWP which is based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in the  modelling of low flows.,

This aligns with preferred or “typical years” duration expressed in the LTWPs. These differ from base flow one as they have a seasonal restriction. The exception for this rule in the Gwydir LTWP which is largely based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in the modelling of low flows.,
Low flow,Base flow one,BF1_b,Base flow one events where durations largely occur at the 5th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur 100% of the time (frequency) to avoid extreme events. This aligns with “dry or very dry years” durations expressed in the LTWPs. The exception for this rule in the Gwydir LTWP which is largely based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in the modelling of low flows.,

Low flow,Base flow two,BF2_a,Base flow two events where durations largely occur at the 50th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur at a minimum of 50% of the time (frequency). This aligns with preferred or “typical years” duration expressed in the LTWPs. These differ from base flow one as they have a seasonal restriction. The exception for this rule in the Gwydir LTWP which is largely based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in the modelling of low flows.,
Low flow,Base flow two,BF2_b,Base flow two events where durations largely occur at the 5th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur 100% of the time (frequency) to avoid extreme event. This aligns with “dry or very dry years” durations expressed in the LTWPs. These differ from base flow one as they have a seasonal restriction. These EWRs vary slightly in the Macquarie as they are based off the 25th percentile at the relevant gauge and should occur 75% of the time (frequency) to avoid extreme events. They also vary in the Gwydir LTWP which is largely based off expert knowledge of the system due to low confidence in the modelling of low flows.,
Low flow,Base flow two,"BF2a, BF2b, BF2c","Only in the Murray- Lower Darling LTWP BF2a, BF2b and BF2c are different to BF2_a and BF2_b and represent three different seasonality’s that the BF2 EWR should occur at. These are based off expert understanding of the system.",
